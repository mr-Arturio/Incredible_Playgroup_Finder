        Conceived and created by an Ottawa Mom, Ottawa parents now have a new,
        incredibly useful tool to plan EarlyON playgroup outings with their
        children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        EarlyON playgroups are an important part of growing up in Ottawa, and
        are often the first opportunity our littles have to head out into the
        world to learn and socialize. Parents can make new friends who are also
        starting a young family, have a safe and welcoming space to ask
        parenting questions and laugh about this crazy new adventure with other
        parents. Each EarlyON has its own unique flavor, and can include access
        to resources such as toy libraries, cool outdoor spaces, parenting
        resources such as books or micro-learning opportunities, playgroups in
        different languages and even free parking or yummy snacks!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This tool will help parents view playgroups that work with their
        schedule â€“ choose to see what you like, based on time of day, age of
        children, day of the week and other categories that make your visit
        fantastic for you.
      </p>

      <p>Come and PLAY!</p>
